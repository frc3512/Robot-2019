# FRC Team 3512's 2018 Robot

Source code for the 2018 comp robot: Diakoptis

Source code also for the 2018 practice robot: Polybius

## Game

The game for 2018 is called FIRST Power Up and there again is a 15 second auton period and 135 second telop period. A key difference in the game this year is that there are scales and switches in which you must place a cube on them and have them tilt in your favor. The points are rewarded on a per second basis so having a rapid auton and fast robot is key. Also in order to accuire a RP you must have all robots across the autoline and to have the switch in your favor. According to calculations auton is 15% of the total score you can get so autonomous is important.

Teleop now has its own paragraph because this year there is a lot of functions. These fucntions are similar to 2015's Talos. These functions include being able to have an elevator go to three different states, to push cubes into a hole in the wall near the ground. As well as placing the cubes we have to climb, and will attempt to raise two other robots with us. This will include ramps and clamps to ensure stability and will also make us have to make a state machine for the climbing mode.

## 2018 Unique Features

This years robot's unique features include:

Two PID driven systems
Intake and outake via wheels (similar to 2016)
Climbing with state machines
Elevator system
Multiple cameras (TBD)
Hall effect limit switch (TBD)
